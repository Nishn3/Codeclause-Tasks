# Project Twitter Sentiment Analysis 

* In this project, I implemented a sentiment analysis model using Logistic Regression. The main objective was to classify text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories based on the content of the text.
* Conducted data collection using Twitter API and data preprocessing to clean and organize the dataset.
* Employed NLP libraries such as NLTK for text tokenization, lemmatization, and feature extraction.
* Implemented a machine learning model (e.g., SVM, Naive Bayes) to predict sentiment based on extracted features.
* Created visualizations and reports to present insights into sentiment trends over time.
